# NEBULA - your thoughts visualized.

## THE CONCEPT...

The average person has 60,000 to 70,000 thoughts in a single day. Imagine how many world changing ideas just come and go without ever entering this reality. Even more intimately, how many of those thoughts are rooted in traumas or limited by preconcieved notions. Studies show that of those 60 to 70 thousand daily thoughts, 90%  stay the same. We need a better way to visualize and analyze our thoughts 

Introducing Nebula - an idea logging app that visually represents & analyses all of your concious thoughts and ideas for better mindfullness. Donâ€™t take your thoughts to Twitter. Grow your Nebula.

## Figma Design Thus Far.. 

Check out the Figma file thus far! There's a component redesign on the horizon for the main UI...

## Project Status (as of 24 Jan 2023... )

Core Home Functionality is Pretty much done! I want this app to be personal so I'm holing off on profile development for social connection. UI is built with buttons that still need some functional configuration. Once we create users and have a running server there will be nebula node presistence on login and the ability to filter through the different caregories of moods to seee unique nebula repesentations! I ran into a rendering issue for the 3D nodes since mobile devices are limited in their capacity in the volume of materials they can process all at once. Currently interview prepping, but I plan on refactoring the nodes to interactable 2D Skia nodes, that swirl about the screen with physics animation properties. Once that change is made, I will plug in my backend, and make components more dynamic via server requests.

## Current Action Steps

P0 - Skia Node Refactoring with Physics Animation Mood Color Matching
P1 - Backend Config With Querying to DB (Supabase or MongoDB)
P2 - Large File Imports for Ideas (Pictures, Videos, VoiceMemos, Music)
P3 - Dynamic Meta Text for Personal Touch / Filter Nebula Functionality / Randomizer Functionality

## Near Future Implementations

1 - Profile Page with private journal sentiment analysis , progressive data vistualization
